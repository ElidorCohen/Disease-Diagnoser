# Disease-Diagnoser

This software serves as an interface for managing and mainly diagnosing a potential disease of a patient according to his blood test values. Of course some of the medical diagnoses are unrealistic, the list of diagnoses was taken from a university site in the US for educational purposes, and does not reflect reality. With the assistance of the software, it will be easier and more efficient to diagnose patient's disease according to his blood test values.

I made and wrote this software as a project that is part of the Software Engineering unit in Sami Shamoon college of Engineering.
